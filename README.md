# Voice-Prescription

A flutter app for digitization of the process of creating prescription for the patients by the doctor. The doctor is required to log in or sign up to the service, draw his signature and he can then diagnose the patients and dictate the prescription which will then be sent to the patient as a formatted PDF via email.
The keywords from the voice input such as patient details like name, age and gender, symptoms, doctor's diagnosis, prescription and general advice are tagged using NLP.
The predictive diagnosis is done with the help of ML.
The entire android app is developed using flutter.
